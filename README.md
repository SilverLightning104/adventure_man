# Adventure Man!

## Description
This game takes place in some grassy hills far away from any civilization. An evil Necromancer has caused the dead to rise from their graves, skeletons to walk again, ghosts to fly around freely, and spiders to be... even _more_ creepy. You (Adventure Man) must push through these monsters and defeat the evil Necromancer.

## Controlls
Use the 'Arrow Keys' to move and "Spacebar" to shoot your gun. The rate of fire is on a cooldown and the spacebar can be held down instead.

## Progress
This game is far from complete. Enemies like skeletons, ghosts, and spiders are planned for the future. The player will hopefully be able to travel on different landscapes and fight new monsters in the future. All that is available now is the first level. You play this level 3 times before "beating" the game.
